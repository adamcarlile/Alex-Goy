JH Portfolio adds a Portfolio section to the WP-Admin and provides portfolio temaplateing either via widgets or tmeplate files.

Add a fully functionality integrated Portfolio to your WordPress site. JH Portfolio comes with a set of widgets for visually creating your portfolio layout, or custom page templates can be used if you want that extra level control over your portfolio design.

= Features =

* Assign entries to their own categories and tags
* Ability to add additional image gallery for each entry
* Whole new admin section for managing your portfolio
* Pretty permalinks
* Automatic server-side thumbnail generation for all/any image sizes

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 0.9.5 =
Some of your old data will be lost: Main Images, Additional Images and your Portfolio Widgets will need setting up. Not compatible with pre 0.9.5 custom templates. See: http://wiki.github.com/joehoyle/JH-Portfolio/0901-and-under-upgrade-to-095 for details.
